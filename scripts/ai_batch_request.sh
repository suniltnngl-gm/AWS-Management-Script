# @brief Batch related AI/automation requests for efficiency and token/cost savings
# @description Accepts a list of scripts/files and a command, then processes them in a single batch. Use this to minimize repeated AI calls and reduce token/credit usage. Integrate with manage.sh for automated workflows.
#
# Usage: ./ai_batch_request.sh <command> <file1> <file2> ...
# Example: ./ai_batch_request.sh lint tools.sh core/helpers.sh
#
# AI Optimization: This script is designed to help both human users and AI assistants process multiple files in a single request, reducing redundant context and improving cost efficiency.
